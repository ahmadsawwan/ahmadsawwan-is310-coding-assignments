The page I scraped is https://www.tvguide.com/news/best-shows-on-hulu/
The reason that I wanted to scrape this page is because I am alwyas looking for a good show to watch. I think that this wiki contains a comprehensive list of different shows that are generally entertaining to the public, therefore it is useful for researchers to find out what interests the public has and find patterns in them. 

 I looked at the robots.txt page (https://www.tvguide.com/robots.txt) and it didnt say that you cant scrape the top shows. 

You need pandas, beutiful soup, requests, and json to run this script.
